#CONCLUSION<br>
This is Electronic Stores Application, where if new user come he/she needs to be Register first  by create User Api.<br>
then they need to to login by using login API, once they logged-in then will get JWT Token.<br>
by taking JWT Token they can do their requirements.<br>
if they want to create product they can create at particular category.<br>
if User wants to upload Imag/file they need to give at particular userId.<br>
suppose if we want to fetch products by user.<br>
if we want to see all products at particular User.<br>
I used ROLE Based Authentication some of API's.<br>
if we want to create Products by Category/User and update products by category etc....
